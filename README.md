# mercury-emission-vis
This is a TouchDesigner project in which we take in data from mercury emissions around the globe. The user can interact with the data through a slider and UI element to explore the data and 'feel' what it means

Gold production & mercury emission
In a conversation with scientists Frits Steenhuisen (Groningen University) and Martine van den Heuvel-Greve (IMARES/Wageningen University) we discovered how artisanal and small scale gold mining can be of significant influence on mercury emissions near the equator and have their effect on the ecosystem in the arctic. With that input we found the base ingredients for an experiment combining data and motion design to create an emotive experience.

Science & emotion
A second part of our motion research was to search for a balance to bring both an informative as an emotional result, as we think the emotive state of a user can be a catalyst for action. To emphasise this idea we also wanted to incorporate sound. Composer and pianist Phillip RÃ¼ttgers delivered a spectrum of tones and chords which gave us the option to combine music with scientific data to create a harmonic or a chaotic situation. This sound library has become part of the result illustrating a result of human action in the need for gold. 

Art installation
We are looking to further develop our design in order to implement an idea of replaceable data input and to further develop a large immersive art installation in which visitors can experience the results of human action on the ecosystem through motion design and music.
In this stage we are presenting a series of short films which show you a result of of our particular experiment and we allow the public to download the project as a Touchdesigner file. We encourage designers to further explore our findings.

You can download the .zip file including a folder with information and the TouchDesigner open Source File
In this folder you will find a .toe (TouchDesigner) file to further explore.
In order to acces and use this file, you will need to install a (free) version of TouchDesigner.
